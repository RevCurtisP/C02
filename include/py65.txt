C02 Header File for py65mon

At the beginning of the program use the directive

  #include <py65,h02>
  
This must be the first include directive.

Defined zero-page memory locations (variables):

  srclo, srchi      Source String Pointer (used by library functions).
  dstlo, dsthi      Destination String Pointer (used by library functions).
  
Defined functions:

  delchr();         Moves cursor one character to the left and
                    deletes character in that position.
                   
                    Note: Writes backspace, space, backspace
                    via prchr($08), prchr($20), and prchr($08).

  c = getkey();     Waits for keypress and returns ASCII code of
                    key that was pressed. 
                    
                    Note: Aliased to rdkey().       

  newlin();         Advances the cursor to the beginning of then
                    next line.
                   
                    Note: Writes carriage return and line feed
                    via prchr($0D) and prchr($0A).

  c = rdkey();      Waits for keypress and returns ASCII code of
                    key that was pressed. 
                    
                    Note: Continuously reads from memory location 
                    getc until a non-zero value is returned.

  prchr(c);         Prints character to screen.
  
                    Note: Writes argument to memory location putc.

  resdst();         Restores the destination pointer from temp1 and 
                    temp2, respectively.

  resreg();         Restores the A, X, and Y registers from temp1, 
                    temp1, and temp2, respectively.

  resrxy();         Restores the X and Y registers from temp1 and 
                    temp2, respectively.

  savdst();         Saves the destination pointer in temp1 and temp2, 
                    respectively.

                    Note: Calls getdst() and savrxy().

  savreg();         Saves the A, X, and Y registers in temp0, temp1,
                    and temp2, respectively.

  savrxy();         Saves the X and Y registers in temp1 and temp2, 
                    respectively.
