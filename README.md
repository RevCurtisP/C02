# C02

C02 is a simple C-syntax language designed to generate highly optimized
code for the 6502 microprocessor. The C02 specification is a highly
specific subset of the C standard with some modifications and extensions

See the top-level [documentation](doc/c02.txt) for more information.

## Building the Compiler
In Linux, use gcc and the [Makefile](./Makefile).

In Windows use the [Pelles C IDE](http://www.smorgasbordet.com/pellesc/) and the file [./C02.ppj](c02.ppj).
