C02 for C programmers

TYPES

C02 only supports one data type: unsigned char.

POINTERS

C02 does not support pointer type variables or parameters. However, the
address-of operator may be used in function calls.


DECLARATIONS

Variable and function names may be no more than six characters in length. 
Multiple variable declarations separated by commas are allowed. 

A variable in a declaration may be initialized by following it with an
equal sign and a constant, however this declaration is done at compile
time, so no re-initialization will occur during code execution.

Array declarations using bracket syntax specify the upper bound, rather
than the array size. Therefore, the array will be allocated with one more
element than the specified number.

EXPRESSIONS

C02 supports the addition, subtraction, bitwise-and, bitwise-or, and 
exclusive-or operators. The multiplication, division, and binary shift
operators are not supported. These can be implemented through functions.
