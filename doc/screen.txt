Screen Control Functions for C02

This is a prototype definition for a library providing functions
to manipulate the screen and move the cursor. Since this code is
highly system dependent, a separate library will need to be 
created for each system type.

The following functions should be defined:

  clrscn();           Clears the screen and returns the cursor to the 
                      home position.
                      
                      Note: May  call a system routine, or may print
                      "clear screen" character sequence.
                      
  crsrhm();           Moves cursor to home position (upper left corner
                      of the screen).    

                      Note: May call mvcrsr(0,0); or may print "cursor
                      home" character sequence.
                      
  crsrlf();           Moves cursor one column to the left. May or may not
                      screen wrap, depending on system.

                      Note: May call mvcrsr; or may print "cursor left"
                      character sequence.

  crsrrt();           Moves cursor one column to the right. May or may not
                      screen wrap, depending on system.
                      
                      Note: May call mvcrsr; or may print "cursor right"
                      character sequence.

  crsrup();           Moves cursor one row up.
                      
                      Note: May call mvcrsr; or may print "cursor up"
                      character sequence.

  crsrdn();           Moves cursor one row down.
                      
                      Note: May call mvcrsr; or may print "cursor down"
                      character sequence.

  mvcrsr(r, c);       Moves cursor to row r, column c.

                      Note: May call system routine, or set system variables.
  
  h = scnhgt();       Returns screen height in rows.
  
                      Note: May call system routine, or read system variable.
                                            
  w = scnwid();       Returns screen width in columns.
  
                      Note: May call system routine, or read system variable.
                                            
  c = scncol();       Returns current screen column.
  
                      Note: May call system routine, or read system variable.
                                            
  r = scnrow();       Returns current screen row.
  
                      Note: May call system routine, or read system variable.
                                            
  txtclr(c);          Sets text color to system color c. 
            
                      Note: May call system routine or may print color change
                      sequence.

  bkgclr(c);          Sets background color to system color c.
                      
                      Note: May call system routine or may print color change
                      sequence.
