The C02 library provides functions for common tasks and allows the 
creation of programs that can be compiled for different systems with 
little or no changes.

Use of the C02 library requires a system specific header, which can be 
specified using the #include directive in the source code or by using
a command line argument when running the compiler. The available 
headers include:

    appl2std    Original Apple 2 (incomplete)
    apple1      Apple 1 (incomplete)
    c64         Commodored 64 (incomplete)
    oric        Oric-1 (incomplete)
    plus4       Commoded Plus/4 (incomplete)
    py65        Python 6502 Emulator - py65mon
    vic3k       Vic-20 with 3k memory (incomplete)
    vic8k       Vic-20 with 8k+ memory (incomplete)

The library functions are contained in various modules. The #include
directive is used to allow the functions in a module to be used in a
program. Most modules require that orher modules be included. These
dependencies are detailed in the documentation for each individual
module. The available modules are as follows:

    stddef      Standard Definitions

                Contains commonly used constants, as well as base
                functions common to nearly every other module.

    stdlib      Standard Library

                Includes the most commonly used functions, including
                mathematical operations and string/numeric conversions.

    stdio       Standard Input/Output

                Contains functions for reading and writing characters 
                and strings from the keyboard and to the screen.

    stdiox      Standard Input/Output Extended

                Contains functions for writing formatted data to the
                screen, including decimal and hexadecimal numbers.

    memio       Memory Input/Ouput

                Provides functions to simulate reading and writing to
                a section of memory as though it were a file.

    string      String functions

                Contains functions for copying, searching, comparing,
                and concatenating strings.

    stringx     String Extended
    
                Contains the more powerful, but less frequently used 
                string manipulation functions.

    memory      Memory functions

                Contains functions for copying, searching, and comparing
                arrays.

    block       Block functions

                Contains functions for reading, writing, and searching 
                for fixed length segments of data to an arbitrarily large 
                section of memory.

    Stack       Stack functions

                Contains functions for pushing and popping variable 
                length segments of data onto and off of a stack in memory.
