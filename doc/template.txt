Template Functions for C02 Programs

This is a template for the documentation of a C02 library module.

At the beginning of the program use the directives

  #include <stddef.h02>
  #include <template.h02>

The following functions are defined:

  c,d,e = func(a,&d);   Stores the input value a and the address of d 
                        in memory.

                        Returns three bytes read from memory.

                        Note: Writes argument a to variable arg0,
                        the address of d to variables adr0 and adr1,
                        and returns the values of variables var0,
                        var1, and var2.

Note: This library expects the following functions to be defined:

  ext();                External function description

along with the zero page variables
  
  zpage0,zpage1:        Zero page variable pair

the external variables
  
  exvar0,exvar1:        External variable pair

and the constants
  
  #CNSTNAME             Constant description
