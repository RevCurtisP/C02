Standard Input/Output Functions for C02 Programs

At the beginning of the program use the directives

  #include <stddef.h02>
  #include <stdio.h02>
  
The following functions are defined:

  c = getc();         Waits for a keypress and returns the cleaned 
                      ASCII value corresponding to the pressed key.
                      
                      Note: Aliased to getchr() from system library.

  putc(c);            Writes character c to the screen.
                      
                      Note: Aliased to putchr() from system library.

  r = gets(&s);       Reads a maximum of 128 characters from keyboard 
                      until the Return/Enter key is pressed, storing the 
                      entered characters as null-terminated string s.
                      
                      Allows corrections using Backspace/Delete. 
                      
                      Pressing the Escape/Abort key terminates entry,
                      leaving the string in an undefined state.
                      
                      Returns number of characters entered, or 255
                      if entry was aborted.

                      Note: Calls getc() in a loop and uses constants 
                      DELKEY, RTNKEY, and ESCKEY from the system library.

  r = puts(&s):       Writes up to 128 characters of null-terminated 
                      string s to the screen.
                      
                      Returns position of null terminator in string.
                      
                      Note: Calls putsub(0, &s).

  r = putsub(n, &s):  Writes up to 128 characters of null-terminated 
                      string s to the screen, starting at position n.
                      
                      Returns position of null terminator in string.
                      
                      Note: Calls putc() in a loop.

  r = putln(&s):      Writes up to 128 characters of null-terminated 
                      string s to the screen and advances the cursor to 
                      the beginning of the next line.
                    
                      Returns number of characters printed.
                    
                      Note: Calls puts(&s) followed by newlin().

Note: This library expects the following functions to be defined:

  getkey();         Wait for and read ASCII character from keyboard
  prchr(c);         Print ASCII character to screen
  delchr();         Backspace and delete previous character on screen
  newlin();         Advance cursor to beginning of next line
  setsrc(&s);       Set source string pointer and initialize index

along with the zero page word
  
  srcptr            Source string pointer

and the assembler constants
  
  DELKEY            Delete/Backspace key ASCII code (usually DEL or BS)
  ESCKEY            Escape/Abort key ASCII code (usually ESC)
  RTNKEY            Return/Enter key ASCII code (usually CR)
