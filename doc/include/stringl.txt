String List Manipulation Module for C02


A string list is a contiguous set of mixed length zero-terminated 
strings followed by a zero byte (empty string). For example:

  char list = {"one","two","three",0};

A string list can be any length. but each entry must be no more than 
the maximum string length of 128 characters long.

The string list functions all make use of the zero-page integer 
variable lstptr. Multiple lists can be accessed by saving and restoring
it's value.

Usage: at the beginning of the program use the directives

  #include <stddef.h02>
  #include <string.h02>
  
The following functions are defined:

  setlst(t);          Sets the list pointer to the beginning of the string
                      list t.
                      
                      This must be called at least once before calling any 
                      of the following functions.

                      Note: Stores &t in lstptr.

  w = strlln(r);      Returns the number of entries in string list r as
                      an integer.
                      
                      Note: Calls strlen() and addsra() for each entry in
                      the list, accumulating the count in temp1 and temp2.

  n, p = strget(s);   Reads the next entry from a string list set by a
                      prior setlst() call into string s.
                      
                      Returns length of the entry and the new position
                      in the string list. When the end of the list is 
                      reached, s is set to an empty string and any further
                      calls to strget() will also return an empty string.
                                        
                      Note: Calls setdst(), getlst(), and strcpy(). If n 
                      is not not zero, calls addsra() and updates lstptr.
                      
  n, p = strput(s);   Writes string s to a string list set by a prior 
                      setlst() call and terminates the string list.
                      
                      Returns length of the entry and the new position in
                      the string list. 
                      
                      Note: Calls setsrc(), getlst(), setdst() and 
                      strcpy(). If n is not zero, calls addsra() and 
                      updates lstptr.
                      

Note: This module expects the following functions to be defined

  addsra(n);          Add accumulator to sorce pointer.
  getlst();           Get list pointer
  setdst(s);          Set destination pointer
  setlst();           Set list pointrt
  setsrc(s);          Set source pointer and initialize index
  strcpy(s);          String copy alternate entry point.

along with the zero page variable pairs
  
  dstptr              Destination String Pointer
  lstprt              List Pointer
  srcptr              Source String Pointer
